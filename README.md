# Enddi Beauty Salon and Makeup

This is the codebase for the website of Enddi Beauty Salon and Makeup, inspired by The Damai Bali. The site is a static HTML/CSS/JS project designed for a luxury beauty and wellness experience.

## Recent Updates (June 2025)

- **New Page:** `nails.html` â€” A dedicated, fully styled page for nail services, featuring formal and friendly content to attract customers. All text is focused on nail care, artistry, and premium service.
- **Content Rewrite:** All text in `nails.html` was rewritten to be formal, friendly, and focused on nails, with customer-attracting language.
- **Performance Optimizations:**
  - All major HTML pages now use `<picture>` with WebP and fallback images for next-gen image support.
  - All `<img>` tags use `loading="lazy"` for lazy loading.
  - CSS is minified (`style.min.css`) and purged of unused styles using PurgeCSS.
  - Main CSS is loaded asynchronously with `<link rel="preload" ... onload="this.rel='stylesheet'">` and `<noscript>` fallback.
  - Key assets (fonts, hero images) are preloaded for faster user experience.
- **SEO & Social:** Updated meta tags for SEO, Open Graph, and Twitter Cards, especially for the new nails page.
- **README:** This documentation was updated to reflect all new features and optimizations.
